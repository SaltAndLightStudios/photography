      <p><strong>June 16, 2025 • 5 min read</strong></p>

      <p>
        Creating a website for <strong>Salt and Light Studios Photography</strong> has been a dream of mine for years. Like many creatives, I’ve had a clear vision in my head but not always the time or tools to bring it to life. My development skills are a bit rusty, and while I’ve built websites in the past, I knew the level of quality I wanted for this one would take months on my own. And let’s be real — time isn’t exactly something I have a lot of these days.

        But things have changed. With tools like ChatGPT, Copilot in Visual Studio Code, and even Canva’s AI features, I was finally able to build something I’m proud of without spending countless late nights troubleshooting or second guessing every design choice.

        I started with inspiration. I’ve always admired the clean, minimalist style of

        and knew I wanted something in that same spirit — something that let the images speak for themselves. I used Canva AI to explore different layout ideas and basic functionality for my design. Canva's AI features for design are phenomenal. I'm stll blown away at how quickly a beautiful website can be created with a few iterations of prompts. Where Canva is lacking is giving the ability to easily modify the content and site. Currently the only way to make modifications is via prompts. After creating a prototype, I realized I needed a more flexible solution that would allow me to easily update and maintain the site over time. So I decided to build it myself using HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript.

        For this building phase, I leaned heavily on ChatGPT to help me clean up my code and solve little problems as they came up. Whether it was a tricky bit of CSS or figuring out how to make my blog posts show in a paginated grid, ChatGPT was there like a helpful second brain. I also tried using Copilot in VS Code to fill in the gaps by predicting and suggesting code patterns as I worked. What would have taken me weeks in the past came together in a matter of days by using these tools.

        I wanted the site to reflect who I am and what Salt and Light Studios is about. At the core, my work is faith-driven. The name <strong>Salt and Light</strong> comes from <em>Matthew 5:13–16</em>, where Jesus calls us to be a light in the world and the salt that brings out the good. I try to carry that same mindset into every project, every photograph, and now into this website. I want the experience of visiting the site to be peaceful, honest, and rooted in something deeper.

        This portfolio isn’t just a collection of photos — it’s a piece of my creative journey. A reflection of growth, grace, and a space to show the skillsets the God has blessed me with. I’m proud of how far it’s come, and even more excited about where it’s going.

        Thanks for following along. And if you're building something of your own, know that you don’t have to do it all alone. Sometimes a little inspiration, a bit of guidance, a prayer or two, and a few smart tools are all you need to finally bring your vision to life.
