    <p><strong>June 16, 2025 • 5 min read</strong></p>

    <p>
      Creating a website for <strong>Salt and Light Studios Photography</strong> has been a dream of mine for years.
      Like many creatives, I had a clear vision in my head but not always the time or tools to bring it to life. My
      development skills were a little rusty, and while I’ve built websites before, I knew the level of quality I wanted
      for this one would take months on my own. And let’s be honest, time is not something I have in abundance these
      days.
    </p>

    <p>
      But things have changed. With tools like ChatGPT, Copilot in Visual Studio Code, and Canva’s AI features, I was
      finally able to build something I’m proud of without countless late nights troubleshooting or second-guessing
      every design choice. Vibe coding is the way of the future for development. If you've never heard of it, look it up! Super cool stuff.

      I started with inspiration. I’ve always admired the clean, minimalist style of
      <a href="https://www.jamespopsys.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James Popsys</a>
      and knew I wanted something in that same spirit. Something that lets the images speak for themselves. Canva’s AI
      helped me explore layout ideas and basic design elements, and honestly, I was blown away at how quickly I could
      generate a beautiful concept with just a few thoughtful prompts.
    </p>

    <p>
      That said, Canva has its limits. Editing content and managing the site long-term felt clunky. At the time of this
      post, most modifications for a Canva AI generated website rely entirely on prompts, which makes ongoing updates harder than they need to be. 
      After prototyping there, I realized I needed something more flexible. So I decided to build a custom site using HTML, CSS,
      and a bit of JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p>
      During the build, I leaned heavily on ChatGPT to help troubleshoot and clean up my code. Whether I was wrangling a
      tricky CSS layout or figuring out how to display my portfolio in a paginated grid, ChatGPT was like a coding buddy,
       always ready with a suggestion or solution. I also used GitHub Copilot in VS Code, which helped fill in the
      gaps by anticipating what I needed as I worked. What would’ve taken me weeks came together in a matter of days.
    </p>

    <p>
      More than just a portfolio, I wanted this site to reflect who I am and what <strong>Salt and Light
        Studios</strong> is about. At its core, my work is faith-driven. The name <em>Salt and Light</em> comes from
      <em><a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/59/MAT.5.13-16.ESV">Matthew 5:13–16</a></em>, where Jesus calls us to be a light in the world and the salt that brings out the good.
      That mindset shapes everything I do, from the photos I take to the way I built this site. I hope the experience
      of visiting here feels peaceful, genuine, and grounded in something deeper.
    </p>

      This portfolio isn’t just a collection of images, it’s part of my creative journey. It’s a reflection of growth,
      grace, and the skillsets God has given me. I’m proud of what’s been built and grateful for how far it’s come. But
      more than that, I’m excited for what’s ahead.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thanks for following along. And if you’re building something of your own, just know, you don’t have to do it all
      on your own. Sometimes a bit of inspiration, a few good tools, and a prayer or two are enough to finally bring
      your vision to life.
